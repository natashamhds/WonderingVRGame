Wondering is a horror genre 3D VR game develoepd using Unity and C# script.
In "Wondering", you assume the role of a student returning to their hometown after a demanding semester at the prestigious UKM. What was supposed to be a restful semester break turns into a race against time when a powerful gust of wind scatters your crucial thesis pages. With the submission deadline looming, you must navigate the transformed and malevolent town to retrieve each page before it's too late.

As you explore the eerie environments, abandoned buildings, and decaying alleyways, you'll encounter paranormal phenomena and ghastly apparitions. The line between reality and nightmare becomes blurred, and mysterious whispers guide you deeper into the darkness. To succeed, you must uncover the town's dark secrets, confront your deepest fears, and outsmart the sinister forces that seek to consume you.
